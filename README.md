# Estuary Application Benchmark Test 
## <a name="1">Introduction</a>
It is to maintain application benchmark test scripts including:
- Scripts which setup benchmark test server and client 
- Scripts which perform benchmark test  

>  Bebfore running Ansible, it is necessary to create new account on target servers. Then the later test could use this account to login in target servers without password.
>  As for how to create new accounts automatically, please refer to [createuser.sh](https://github.com/open-estuary/appbenchmark/blob/master/apps/e-commerce-solutions/e-commerce-springcloud-microservice/createuser.sh)

>  It is required to write new benchmark scripts based on `ansible` framework. In addition, some existing old scripts might be changed to `ansible` framework in the future. As for test cases based on `ansible` framework, it might be necessary to change some configurations before setting up benchmark test based on real test environment, such as: `ansible/hosts` which specifies test hosts,
>   and `ansible/group_vars/*` which define variables for this test.

## <a name="2">Benchmark Test</a>
Usually it is only necessary to execute following commands in order to perform benchmark test for each application:
- `./setup.sh` to setup client and server side;
- `./run_{test/xxx}.sh` to perform benchmark test on client side

Currently the following applications have been supported so far :
- Basic Test
